title: "Analysis"
row1title: Triangulation
row1content: >
  Using multiple data sources to provide a more accurate understanding of the problem. Triangulation identifies patterns from two or more research disciplines.
row2title: Affinity diagrams
row2content: >
  Giving structure and guidance to qualitative data, allowing the whole team to be involved from brainstorming to analysing. An affinity diagram needs:
  
  1. Research 
  
  2. Share findings with the team 
  
  3. The team will digest, make notes and observations on a post-it notes 
  
  4. Place post-it notes on a wall to review
  
  5. Organise post-it notes into groups
  
  6. Give each group a name
  
  7. Unstructured data is now structured

  
  Why use affinity diagrams? This gives everyone in the team a voice, getting everyone working collaboratively and sharing ideas to quickly analyse the research.
row3title: Customer journey mapping 
row3content: >
  A diagram that visualises the customer experience as they interact with the website. It highlights aspects of the journey that needs to be fixed. Within the flow of using a website the customer will take many steps, whether ‘enter your details’ ‘get a quote’ ‘register online’, highlighting patterns within each step establishing user goals, behaviours, context, pain points and opportunities. The experience within each step is assessed if it’s positive or negative and mapped on the diagram. This indicates what needs to be fixed to ensure the user has a positive experience.

Now that the research phase is complete, data can be analysed. 

Three analysis tools will be used: triangulation, affinity diagrams and customer journey mapping.
