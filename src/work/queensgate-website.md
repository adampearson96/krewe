row1title: The Challenge
row1content: >
  Create an online shop window representing the new brand, the retailers and its demographic. With popularity increasing for Google My Business, the website has to provide an interesting and engaging offering, to encourage and entice users to visit, explore and re-visit the website.
row2title: Research
row2content: >
  With an existing website in place, we were able to look at Analytics, highlighting:

  * Bounce rate of 55.2%
  

  * Average session time of 1.11 minutes


  * Session duration was 1-10 seconds


  * Top visited pages were shops, jobs, opening hours, mall guide, parking


  * Top exited pages were opening hours, shops, gift card, parking, jobs


  * Typical flow through the website was homepage – shops – your visit – jobs


  * The demographic was interested in TV, 30-minute chef, news, shopping, family and food


  Problems uncovered:

  * Lack of time spent on the website


  * Top visited pages were also the top exited page indicating users were visiting with one purpose in mind


  * Lack on content on the website encouraging people to explore and stay on it

row3title: Analysis
row3content: >
  A customer journey map was conducted to reveal which sections users were happy with and pain points. We found overall, customers were happy with Google My Business information on retailers, but wanted quick links to relevant pages and felt content was limited and underwhelming.

  Where the information architecture, user flow and navigation are defined. Based on research, analysis and branding we recommended that: 

  * Incorporated a blog covering demographic interests such as Discover section on tv, news and books, Explore section on food, chefs and recipes and Uncover section on family and shopping, utilising the brands tone of voice. This should lead to increase session duration and repeat visits 


  * Relevant content on all pages linking through to other pages of interest, which should increase page views 


  A site map was created with an important emphasis on:


  * Simple and relevant global navigation


  * Homepage links to the top visited pages from the existing website

row5title: Prototyping
row5content: >
  After sketching out screen states, we converted them into Sketch and tested with the user. Each screen state was designed due to the complexity and size of the website. 
row6title: End Product
row6content: >
  A brand optimised design, incorporating the brand’s tone of voice and positioning. A responsive design, encouraging flow through the website with relevant page links, a dedicated blog section and a food and drink page to entice the foodie demographic. 
  
  Results: 
  
  * Session duration increased to 1.15 minutes


  * Decreased bounce rate to 44.5%


  * More pages visited before leaving the site, with a flow of homepage – stores – food and drink - Explore
