row1title: The Challenge
row1content: >
  With only a retailer logo landing page, we were tasked to promote individual retailers with a dedicated page and inject new brand style into the website. The centre comprises of two separate sections with very different retail offerings, which needed to be clearly communicated on the website, along with a strong focus on food and drink.
row2title: Research
row2content: >
  Google Analytics highlighted:


  * Most popular pages were store directory, opening times, eating, women’s fashion


  * Highest exited pages were parking, store directory, opening times, food


  * Average user spends 26 seconds on a page before leaving


  With the average session duration lasting 2 minutes and 17 seconds, 26 seconds is relatively short, presenting a problem needing to be solved.

  Global and local navigation were identified within the site map, ensuring there was a dedicated area promoting the two shopping sections. The main objective was to push users to three core offerings: retailers, F&B and the two shopping sections, therefore it was important that the user could access content from the nav and homepage.

  Medium fidelity prototypes were created and tested with the user. Once validated, these were annotated to inform and instruct the developer. Notes included functionality instructions, store placement filters and categories and click through page directions.

  After testing the initial homepage build, the top section was slightly amended to improve usability. Bring the branding to life using clever scroll functionality, whcih clearly communicates the centre’s offerings. Within each page there are links through to either the stores page or the F&B page, ensuring the user is directed to core offerings throughout their journey.


  **Results:**

  * Average time spent on the website increased to 1.27 minutes
  
  
  * Flow through the site: homepage – stores – food and drink – find us
