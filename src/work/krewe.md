  To understand the competitors, research was conducted to fully understand their offering and how they represented themselves online. This research fed into the brand and core business offerings that would provide Krewe with a competitive edge and USP. Once this was established the new branding was created. The new brand represents the agencies core offerings of UX, UI and web development but in a digital and interactive manner.

It was crucial that the website was easy to navigate through, with key information on the homepage with limited click throughs to inner pages of the website. The interactions and animations were a crucial element to consider, ensuring it emerged the user into the brand and encourage them to get in contact.
