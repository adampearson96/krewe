row1title: Challenge
row1content: >
  With an outdated design, heavily populated and complicated medical copy, hard to navigate and poor user experience, the BONDS website was in need of an update. KREWE were tasked to create a new website for detox services which catered for two audiences; tailoring tone of voice, user flow and CTA for both the patient and their ‘loved ones’. In addition to this, as the business provides detox and rehabilitation for addicts, it was crucial that the website was compliant and respectful for those seeking advice.

row2title: Research
row2content: >
  The first step was to understand how the audience interacted with the current website in order to identify opportunities. This exercise included:

  -	Google Analytic research – understanding user flow, drop off points, entry points, devices etc
  
  -	Heat maps – to have clear idea what users were interacting with and what elements were getting higher interaction 
  
  -	Online surveys – to understand the current audience and their needs from the website
  
  -	Usability testing – in-depth tasked based research to understand how the website performed with differing audiences
  
  In order to gain a broader understanding of the market KREWE also undertook the following:

  -	Competitor benchmarking – to fully understand the competitor

  Conducting such research highlighted one key opportunity: users were landing on the homepage, scrolling half-way down and then exit. Usability tests highlighted that the current website did not cater to the ‘loved ones’ who predominately used the website to search for a compatible detox clinic who revealed that they found the content insensitive and confusing.

row3title: Analysis
row3content: >
  Upon completion of this study, the findings were analysed using:
  
  -	Affinity diagrams – giving structure to shapeless data in order to form groups with meaning. A tool which would aid with site map and navigation planning
  
  -	Customer journey – establishing pain points, opportunities and behaviour of the user when interacting with the website 

  This analysis highlighted many opportunities for the new website. Examples outlined below:
  
  -	There was no information on the programme itself, where it took place, the price or if there was any help or support once the detox was complete
  
  -	The website did not feature any stats or testimonials from previous patients which did not instil any confidence with prospective clients

row4title: Design
row4content: >
  Within this phase the following were created:
  
  -	User flow – considering how the user will flow through the website, including entry and exit points and what content needed to be on which page
  
  -	Site map – including all pages and relevant content based on user flow  
  
  -	Navigation – considering global and local navigation 

  It was apparent from the research and analysis that there was a need for clear sections covering the following:
  
  -	‘Loved ones’ and how could they help patients
  
  -	Content that was not condescending and aided understanding
  
  -	Clear outline of the detox programme
  
  -	Understanding of the services that followed detox
  
  -	Testimonial and stats

row5title: Wireframe
row5content: >
  Once the design received client approval KREWE progressed to wireframe; all pages were wireframed including desktop, mobile and menu.

row6title: Prototyping
row6content: >
  To visualise the wireframes, medium fidelity prototypes were created in Invision. This allows those trialling to navigate and flow through the website as though it were live. This process aims to highlight if there are any issues that need to be addressed before handing over to the design and development team.

row7title: End Product
row7content: >
  The UI and website development were completed by the KREWE team.

  The new website is now customer-centric ensuring all flows cater to both target audiences. It has a clear CTA which is sensitive to the end user and the website not only provides information on the business services but also provides a reference point to find out more about drugs, causes, effects and behaviour of addiction. There is a strong presence of testimonials and video content to balance medical copy and aid with understanding.
