row1title: Challenge
row1content: >
  The appliance page receives high traffic; however, the functionality and experience doesn’t drive users to convert from website visits to website enquiry. With the ultimate goal of generating appointments to the showroom, ensuring the UI improvements made were tactical to increase visibility on Google by demonstrating trust and reliability and also have a competitive edge.

row2content: >
  Before putting pen to paper, competitor benchmarking was conducted which included researching the direct competitors but also other companies in different industries. This helped to demonstrate what worked well and what didn’t, which would feed into the design of the new appliance page.

  Once the design was completed, it was uploaded onto InVision and tested with the user to highlight if there are any problems and amends needed.
