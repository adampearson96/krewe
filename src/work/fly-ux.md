row1title: The Challenge
row1content: >
  With no existing website, start-up business Fly UX wanted to create a website that would excel in customer experience by providing users with a fluid, transparent and stress-free flow through the website. There was a clear focus on providing the customer with the right tools to easily search, book and pay for flights. With a secondary focus on adding extras to the booking without being re-directed to 3rd party websites and an uncomplicated check-in process.

  By conducting usability testing with ScreenFlow, depth interviews, online surveys using Survey Monkey and competitive benchmarking it gave insight into the customer, their behaviour and the problem that needed to be solved. Research highlighted that booking multiple flights, direct flights searches, sharing search results with friends or saving to an admin area to view and compare later, were either complicated or not possible. Flight prices were not visible or transparent until payment and extras and online check-in were redirected to 3rd party websites, making the process cumbersome. This helped identify problems that the new website needed to solve.
row3title: Analysis

  Research with affinity diagrams highlighted groups, patterns and themes, helping to create a user orientated structure to the website through enhanced features and content placement and grouping. A customer journey map was also insightful in showing which sections of the website customers were happy with including pain points. Interestingly, customers were unhappy with the number of adverts and cross-selling, which slowed down the booking process.

  The design stage is where the information architecture, user flow and navigation are defined and allocated. A site map was created to determine where content sits, how the user flows through different screen states and the structure of the website. Competitor research and analysis highlighted a lack of user-friendly admin areas, therefore FLY UX had to have a compelling admin area. There was a strong focus on how this area would work and how to push users to benefit from signing up.
row5title: Interactive Design

  Interactive design is when we put pen to paper and sketch the screen states and navigation. This stage is crucial in ensuring the project is a success as it allows for interpretation, feedback and amendments before prototyping.
row6title: Prototyping
row6content: >
  The approved sketches were converted into Sketch and uploaded to InVision to create an interactive experience. For this type of website, a medium fidelity prototype was needed to test the functionality, navigation and flow. Once uploaded to InVision the user was able to test, amend and validate before the wireframes were created.

  The individual screen states were annotated with notes, instructions, rules and error messaging ready to be handed over to the developer.
row8title: End Product
row8content: >
  A clear, simple and user-friendly website with the ability to promote to friends with a flight share button, increase return visits with an interactive and informative admin area and a structured linear flow to searching, booking and paying for flights. The design is interactive, perceivable and predictable, using clever features such as process indicators, digital affordances, IP recognition, error handling and inline validation.
