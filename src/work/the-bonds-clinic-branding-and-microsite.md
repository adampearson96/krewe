row1title: Background
row1content: >
  The BONDS Clinic are a family run business based in Yorkshire specialising in addiction treatment for opioids, prescription medication, alcohol, cocaine and many more. They have become one of the global leaders in their field, delivering a treatment programme which places abstinence as priority and are on hand to deliver a holistic treatment, tailored to the individual’s needs.

  With an exciting location move to the Broughton Estate grounds in Skipton and expansion plans, The BONDS Clinic approached KREWE to uncover and discover the true meaning behind its brand, positioning, USP, demographic, services and offering. With the original brand created in 2000 it was time for a brand revamp and new website.

  We kicked things off (during lockdown 1.0) with a remote brand workshop, which helped to uncover the brand purpose, vision, mission, values, personality, positioning target audience including a two-prong approach of patient and loved one and competitors. This vital information directed the new brand which symbolises the connections and bonds made throughout detox by working with the patient not against, by liberating your true self and achieving the real you, and with the knowledge and experience the team has, recovery is successful for a life a better you.

  To support the marketing activity whilst the full website is under construction, the team asked for a microsite. This would be a simple one page website, with a separate blog page in the new brand. Wireframes were created to ensure that users can easily access information without scrolling through the page by implementing anchor links on the header sections. The new brand has been rolled out across brochures, leaflets and DM. The design mimics that of the full new website set to go live early 2021, watch this space!

  Within two months, the microsite has had 113 users click on the call us, email us and submit enquiry buttons – which is the main CTA for the website. This has converted 8 users into patients. The microsite has seen an 400% increase in conversions in just two months.
