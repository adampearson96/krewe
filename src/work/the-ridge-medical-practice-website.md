row1title: Challenge
row1content: >
  As the pandemic struck, GP practices had to change the way they dealt with patients; no longer could they sit around in waiting rooms or see a doctor without a telephone consultation first. A new website was needed for The Ridge Medical Practice to overcome this challenge, in order to reduce face-to-face appointments, encourage patients to self-diagnose alongside housing useful NHS external links and local healthcare support.

row2title: Research & Analysis
row2content: >
  The first step was to understand how the audience interacted with the current website in order to identify opportunities. This exercise included:
  - Google Analytic research – understanding user flow, drop off points, entry points, devices etc.
  - Heat maps – to have clear idea what users were interacting with and what elements were getting higher interaction 

  In order to gain a broader understanding of the market KREWE also undertook the following:
  -	Competitor benchmarking – to fully understand the broader context

  Further to this research, it was apparent that users predominantly used the website for:
  -	Booking an appointment
  -	Repeated prescriptions 
  -	Contact details for the other branches
  -	Information on current affairs, such as COVID

  Upon completion of this study, the findings were analysed using:
  -	Affinity diagrams – giving structure to shapeless data in order to form groups with meaning. A tool which would aid with site map and navigation planning

  This analysis was used to build up a view of what content needed to be on the new website. Although the business objective of reducing face-to-face of appointments had to be the clear focus for the new website, users also wanted to have easy access to book appointments and therefore was crucial not to alienate them but re-educate.

row3title: Design
row3content: >
  Within this phase the following were created:
  -	User flow – considering how the user will flow through the website, including entry and exit points and what content needed to be on which page
  -	Site map – including all pages and relevant content based on user flow  
  -	Navigation – considering global and local navigation 

  As the new websites purpose is to encourage patients to research a condition before booking an appointment, it was key to create helpful suggestions, links to relevant conditions, help and advice as well as providing online consultations via the use of webGP. This functionality had to be easily accessible throughout the website.  

row4title: Wireframe
row4content: >
  On receiving client approval KREWE progressed to the wireframes; all pages were wireframed including desktop, mobile and menu. To encourage users to search a condition or book an appointment, a search bar functionality was incorporated onto the website, along with a search pop out tab that was constantly visible while interacting with the website. As per the objectives, a key consideration was to ensure hierarchy of content, yet in addition to this traditional user behaviours were factored in.

row5title: Prototyping
row5content: >
  To visualise the wireframes, medium fidelity prototypes were created in Invision. This allows those trialling to navigate and flow through the website as though it were live. This process aims to highlight if there are any issues that need to be addressed before handing over to the design and development team.
  
row6title: End Product
row6content: >
  The UI and website development were completed by the KREWE team. A key feature of the website is the search functionality. With time and increased data, this site will learn and adapt, better understanding what users are searching for and creating a more interactive search bar with the ability to ask questions.
