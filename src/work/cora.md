  As this is a one-page website – the menu tabs act as anchor links – and is a fixed top navigation as you scroll through the website – with quick access to section of the website you want to access. 
  
  A sitemap was created to ensure all the correct copy and sections were on the website, but condensed and easy to navigate through.

  Simple and easy to navigate website, containing all the relevant information without feeling cluttered and overbearing. The fixed top nav provides easy navigation to the right section of the website without taking you away from the homepage. Users can easily reserve a table, or buy and pick up an order.
