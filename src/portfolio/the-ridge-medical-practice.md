projectDescription: As the pandemic struck, GP practices had to change the way they dealt with patients; no longer could they sit around in waiting rooms or see a doctor without a telephone consultation first. A new website was needed for The Ridge Medical Practice to overcome this challenge, in order to reduce face-to-face appointments, encourage patients to self-diagnose alongside housing useful NHS external links and local healthcare support.
